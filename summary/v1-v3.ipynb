    "# Understanding Anchor Boxes in YOLO\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchor boxes are a key concept in object detection that evolved across the YOLO versions. Let me explain them in depth and show how they differ between YOLO v1, v2, and v3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Anchor Boxes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchor boxes are predefined bounding box shapes (with specific width-to-height ratios) that serve as reference templates for detecting objects. They're essentially \"prior\" shapes that the model uses as starting points when predicting the actual bounding boxes around objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of anchor boxes as a set of differently shaped \"cookie cutters\" that the model can use as starting points, then adjust to better fit the actual objects in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem Anchor Boxes Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "In early object detectors like YOLO v1, each grid cell could only predict one object. This created a significant limitation: **what happens when multiple objects have their center point in the same grid cell?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a person is standing next to a bicycle and both their center points fall within the same grid cell, YOLO v1 could only detect one of them, not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOLO v1: No Anchor Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "In YOLO v1:\n",
    "- The image was divided into a 7×7 grid\n",
    "- Each grid cell predicted 2 bounding boxes directly\n",
    "- Each grid cell could only predict ONE object class (major limitation)\n",
    "- Total predictions: 7×7×2 = 98 boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO v1 didn't use anchor boxes - instead, it directly predicted width and height values for each bounding box from scratch. This meant the network had to learn appropriate shapes for all possible objects without any prior knowledge, making training more difficult and reducing accuracy for unusual object shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOLO v2: Introduction of Anchor Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO v2 made a crucial improvement by introducing anchor boxes:\n",
    "- The image was divided into a 13×13 grid\n",
    "- Each grid cell used 5 anchor boxes\n",
    "- Each anchor box could predict a full set of values (coordinates, dimensions, objectness, class probabilities)\n",
    "- Each grid cell could now detect up to 5 different objects\n",
    "- Total predictions: 13×13×5 = 845 boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The anchor boxes in YOLO v2 were pre-determined using k-means clustering on the training dataset to find the 5 most representative box shapes for the objects in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Anchor Boxes Work in YOLO v2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of predicting absolute width and height, the network predicts adjustments to the predefined anchor box dimensions\n",
    "2. For each anchor box, the network predicts:\n",
    "   - tx, ty: adjustments to the center coordinates\n",
    "   - tw, th: adjustments to the width and height\n",
    "   - Confidence score: likelihood of containing an object\n",
    "   - Class probabilities: what the object might be\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provided several advantages:\n",
    "- Made it easier for the network to learn appropriate shapes\n",
    "- Allowed detection of multiple objects in the same grid cell\n",
    "- Improved accuracy for objects with varied aspect ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOLO v3: Refined Anchor Boxes at Multiple Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO v3 further refined the anchor box approach:\n",
    "- Used 3 anchor boxes per grid cell (down from 5 in v2)\n",
    "- Applied these anchor boxes at three different scales (13×13, 26×26, and 52×52)\n",
    "- Each scale used anchor boxes of appropriate sizes (larger boxes for the 13×13 scale, smaller boxes for the 52×52 scale)\n",
    "- Total predictions: (13×13 + 26×26 + 52×52)×3 = 10,647 boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction process remained similar to YOLO v2, but was now performed at multiple scales, allowing for much better detection of objects of varying sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bounding Box Prediction Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In both YOLO v2 and v3, the bounding box prediction with anchor boxes works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The output values from the network (tx, ty, tw, th) are adjustments to the anchor boxes\n",
    "2. For coordinates:\n",
    "   - bx = σ(tx) + cx (where cx is the x-coordinate of the grid cell)\n",
    "   - by = σ(ty) + cy (where cy is the y-coordinate of the grid cell)\n",
    "3. For dimensions:\n",
    "   - bw = pw × e^tw (where pw is the width of the anchor box)\n",
    "   - bh = ph × e^th (where ph is the height of the anchor box)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function (σ) constrains the coordinate predictions to be relative to the grid cell (0 to 1), while the exponential function ensures that width and height adjustments are always positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "| Version | Grid Size | Anchor Boxes | Total Predictions | Multi-Object per Cell |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| YOLO v1 | 7×7       | None         | 98                | No (only 1 class)      |\n",
    "| YOLO v2 | 13×13     | 5 per cell   | 845               | Yes (up to 5)          |\n",
    "| YOLO v3 | 13×13, 26×26, 52×52 | 3 per cell | 10,647   | Yes (up to 3 per scale) |\n",
    "\n",
    "By evolving from no anchor boxes to using multiple anchor boxes at multiple scales, YOLO dramatically improved its ability to detect objects of various shapes and sizes, especially small objects and multiple objects located close together."
